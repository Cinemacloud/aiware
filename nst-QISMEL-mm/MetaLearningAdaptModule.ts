/**
 * Meta-Learning and Adaptation Module
 * 
 * Purpose: 
 * This module is responsible for optimizing the learning process itself.
 * It implements meta-learning strategies to adapt the agent's learning
 * algorithms and parameters based on the task and environment. It also
 * includes evolutionary optimization to explore and refine the agent's
 * overall architecture and strategies.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Meta-learning for adaptive learning strategies
 * - Evolutionary optimization for architectural refinement
 * - Dynamic adjustment of learning parameters
 *
